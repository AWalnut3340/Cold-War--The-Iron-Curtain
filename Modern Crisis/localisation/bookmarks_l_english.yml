 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The 1980s"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "By the dawn of 1980 the world was still split in two; Communism and Democracy, but the once mighty Soviet Union starting to faulter, the US under threat from much of what they had created. Europe under threat from both the 'Red Menace' and their own Nationalist ideologies, South America being reduced to almost perpetual revolutions and civil wars, while decolonisation in Africa is almost completed. What will happen to the world? Total war? Total Peace? Somewhere between? That is a choice to the countries of the world and theirs alone!"
