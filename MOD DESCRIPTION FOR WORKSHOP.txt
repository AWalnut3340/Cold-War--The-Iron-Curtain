[h1]Cold War: The Iron Curtain[/h1]
This mod adds a [b]Cold War scenario[/b] into Hearts or Iron IV. It starts in 1949, right after the formation of a west-german state, and is planned to end around 1990 or 2000. So, in total, you can play for 41 or 51 years! This of course takes a lot of time and effort to archive, but we are constantly doing our best to bring you the first and most awesome Cold War mod there is on the Steam Workshop!
