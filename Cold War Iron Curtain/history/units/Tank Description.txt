M24 Chaffee:
The M24 Chaffee was developed in 1943 by the US to be used as a light tank to replace the old M5 Stuart light tank. Production of the tank soon started in 1944 and saw service in France, Belgium, The Netherlands, and Germany. The M24 Chaffe is known for their off-road performance and the reliability, but the 75 mm main gun was the main feature than the 37 mm used by the M5 Stuart. After World War II, the M24 went on to serve in other countries' armies as part of the Marshall Plan. The tank soon saw service once the Korean War broke out, however the M24 was too weak against the superior T-34-85s. They were soon reassigned from light tank roles to reconaissance roles. The M24 was replaced by the M41 Walker Bulldog in 1952. The tank still saw service in other countries up to the early 1980's. 

M41 Walker Bulldog:
The M41 Walker Bulldog was developed to replace the M24 Chaffee. The US started development in 1947 to find a replacement for the M24 Chaffee. The tank was supposed to be air-transportable and to have a more powerful 76 mm main gun. Production of the tank began in 1951 at the start of the Korean War. The first American tank divisions recieved them in 1952 with great performance against enemy tanks. By 1953 the M41 completely replaced the M24 Chaffee. After the Korean War the tank was exported to many countries around the world to help them fight the War against Communism. The M41 was soon began replaced by the US in 1969 by the M551 Sherdian tank. The M41 Walker Bulldog is still in service in 6 countries today. 

M41A1 Walker Bulldog:
After the Korean War, the US Army found some flaws in the M41 design. The turret traverse was a bit too slow than other tanks in serivce. The tank was also bulky and needed to be smaller. The US Army began work on the M41A1 in 1954 by giving the tank a electrical turret and a more compact design that made it harder to see. The M41A1 was put into service in 1955.

M41A2 Walker Bulldog:
The US Army found the M41A1 to be slower in harsher environements and moved slowly. The US Army wanted to fix this problem and in 1956 they began production of the M41A2 Walker Bulldog, by giving a fuel injected Continental AOS 895-3 6-cylinder gasoline engine that sped the M41 up. 

M50 Ontos:
Ontos in Greek means thing. Probably one of the weirder tank designs of the Cold War, the US Army experimented with light tanks in the 1950s to find better ways around the Soviet's angled armor. The M50 Ontos started development in the early 1950s to find a light tank that can have a lot of guns, but can be airdropped in combat zones faster. The first vehicle was put to test in 1952 with 4 M40 106 mm recoiless rifles. The Army didn't see it useful and made a second model. This time they added 2 more M40 rifles with 6 M1919 machine guns for infantry support. The tank passed development and went to in service with the Marines in 1956, while the Army cancelled their order for the tank being far from their tank doctrine. The M50 saw service for the first time in Vietnam. The tanks however we deactivated in 1969 and were never used again. 

M56 Scorpion:
The M56 was a light developed by the US Army for use with the Airborne divisions. The tank was produced from 1953 to 1959. The M56 only saw service in the Vietnam War. The tank was exported to 3 other countries and the last M56s were deactivated in the late 1970s. 

M551 Sheridan: 
The M551 Sheridan was developed by the US Army to be a airborne tank and a fast tank to be used in battle. The Sheridan was the first tank in the US Army to include a main gun, but could fire ATGMs. The tank was produced from 1967 and saw action in 1969 in Vietnam. The M551 replaced the M41 starting in 1970. The Sheridan was in great use to do the movement of the tank being so fast and couldn't get bogged down in mud. The Army started to phase out the tank in 1976 but had no replacement. The tank saw service in Operation Desert Storm and the last M551s were deactivated in 1996. 

M8 Burford:
The M8 Burford was intended to replace the M551 Sheridan in the late 80s and early 90s. After 1976 the US Army looked for replacements for the M551 Sheridan. The M8 Burford was the main choice to replace the M551. However the cost was too high and overbudget, so the tank was cancelled in 1995. Only 6 models were made. If accepted the tank would be the most expensive light tank in US history due to all of the modules and electronics in it.
