 swf.7.d:0 "Today we all gather in Warsaw, Poland to reaffirm our desire of for an establishment of a collective European security based alliance irrespective of our social or political systems. The Cold War has gotten worse over the years and more lines are being drawn. Now with the rearming of the German states we need to make sure we are prepare for a full armed conflict erupting in the German region or elsewhere. The Cominform has been a great alliance, but we need to strengthen the East against the West. The Warsaw Pact shall be created to protect any members no matter their social or political systems. We shall be united against the enemies of the Warsaw Pact. The Cominform is dead! Long live the Warsaw Pact!"
 swf.9.d:0 "After a conference in Warsaw, Poland, the Eastern Bloc and other Soviet allies signed a national defense and alliance treaty. They disbanded the Cominform and formed the Warsaw Pact in its replacement. The Soviets said that due to the higher tensions and the rearming of the Germans, that a stronger alliance is needed to protect the countries in the East against the West. NATO has made a statement saying that will still fight the Communist threat no matter what and that this changes nothing. Tensions are still high in Europe and now have gotten bigger due a new military alliance."
