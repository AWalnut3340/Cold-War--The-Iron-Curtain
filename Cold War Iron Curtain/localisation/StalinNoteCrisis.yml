 notecrisis.1.t:0 "Stalin Note from USSR"
 notecrisis.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union has sent us a peace treaty to us. They said that West and East Germany will united into one neutral country. The neutral Germany will also have no alliances. This will most likely not last long. The neutral Germany will also be able to form an army. Now this will help the Soviets in protection because this neutral Germany will be a buffer zone for them. Though some of our advisors say that this will help stop a war hopefully breaking out in Germany. What do we say to the Soviets?"
 notecrisis.1.a:0 "The Stalin Note sounds like a good deal for peace"
 notecrisis.1.b:0 "No. This treaty helps the Communists more than us."
