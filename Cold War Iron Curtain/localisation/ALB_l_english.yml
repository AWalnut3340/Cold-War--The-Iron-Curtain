 political.29.d:0 "The citizenry of [Root.GetName] are growing tired of the constant redundancy cause by the current systems in place and yearn for change. For this, many are looking to the past and the glories once brought upon nations from monarchies. As everyday citizens of the nation learn of the evergrowing support for a monarch, many others will also look to the footnotes of history for the answers to our problems."
 political.29.a:0 "Perhaps the politicians will fight for the monarchy."
 political.29.a.tt:0 "Increases the chance of internal support for a restoration of the monarchy."
 political.29.b:0 "The nation's citizenry will likely restore the crown."
 political.29.b.tt:0 "Increases the chance of popular support for a restoration of the monarchy."
 political.30.t:0 "The [GetMonth] March of [Root.GetAdjective] Monarchists"
 political.30.d:0 "The claimant to the [Root.GetAdjective] throne has gathered an army of a few thousand men and stormed the capital of [Root.GetName] earlier this morning demanding for a referendum to take place deciding whether or not to instate the monarchy. With the current support for the proposed monarchy, it is unlikely that the general populace will react peacefully to a rejection of this demand, and it is even less likely that they are willing to wait."
 political.30.a:0 "A referendum will take place."
 political.30.b:0 "No monarch belongs in [Root.GetName]!"
 political.31.t:0 "Meeting with [Root.GetLeader]"

While [Root.GetLeader] is reluctant to give up power, it is no secret that the people are growing tired of the current system in place. The [Root.GetAdjective] Monarch claims that the people's will must be fulfilled for the overall stability of the nation and as there are many nations who wish to see us crumble, we must have a strong leader who will keep us united and safe."
 political.31.a:0 "Perhaps he is right."
 political.31.b:0 "How foolish! Exile him immediately."
 political.32.t:0 "Striving Monarch"
 political.32.d:0 "The intentions of the claimant to the [Root.GetAdjective] throne could not be more clear.

If the current systems are to stay in-place, much must be solved to calm the evergrowing tension in the nation."
 political.32.a:0 "Only a monarch can truly unite a nation."
 political.33.t:0 "Increase Support for Monarchism"
 political.33.d:0 "Constant rallies, speeches, and protests flood the street and fill the air-waves, spreading the message of what many hope to be the very near future. The people could not reveal their desires any clearer: They want a monarchy and are willing to fight for it. They now wait for the response of the [Root.GetAdjective] government."
 political.33.a:0 "It is undeniable that change is right around the corner."
 political.34.t:0 "Authoritarianism in [Root.GetName]"
 political.34.d:0 "Aside from monarchism, other right-wing ideologies, such as nationalism and fascism have been gaining popularity in our nation, albeit to a far less extent than monarchism has. With the direction that the populace's ideologies have been and continue to had, we should expect this trend to continue."
 political.34.a:0 "These doctrines are becoming mainstream."
 political.35.t:0 "Monarchy and the Establishment"
 political.35.d:0 "Though the citizenry supporting the newly founded concept of a [Root.GetAdjective] monarch is no longer suprising, politicians openly supporting the movement is. Over the months, more politicians have openly expressed their desire for a monarch. With the backing of the nation's politicians, [Root.GetAdjective] monarchists are now gaining much more support for their cause."
 political.35.a:0 "The monarchy now has the support of the establishment."
