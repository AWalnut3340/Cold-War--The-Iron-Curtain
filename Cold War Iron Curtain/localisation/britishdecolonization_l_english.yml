 britishdecolonization.1.t:0 "Class B Mandate of Tanganyika"
 britishdecolonization.1.d:0 "The aftermath of World War I brought the Treaty of Versailles to be signed on June 28,1919 by the Central Powers and Entente. The former League of Nations would partition German East Africa on July 20, 1922 with Belgium and Britain. Tanganyika was assigned into a Class B Mandate to be released once independence was possible. The new United Nations Trust Territory Committee reassigned us the colony in 1946, and a independence referendum to be supported. Recent polling has showed that 67% of colonists in Tanganyika are ready to be independent. With this in mind, Tanganyika does offer a lot of resources and transportation routes for our other colonies in the area. Should we allow Tanganyika to become an independent nation or not?"

On July 20, 1922 The United Kingdom was given the state of Tanganyika from German East Africa. Tanganyika was placed on a Class B Mandate to be released once independence was possible.
