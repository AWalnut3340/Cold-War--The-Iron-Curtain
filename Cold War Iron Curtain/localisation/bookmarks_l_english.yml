The British and French strongholds across the world are threatened due to constant revolutions, and diminishing power. The two greatest victors of World War 2 have risen, causing a great divide in the world. The United States and the Soviet Union have split the world in their ideologies in order to hold the most power... Uncle Sam versus the Great Russian Bear! It is up to the player to decide how democracy will flourish, or if communism will hold the world."

North Korea, a neighboring country set free by their communist victors, is now threatening South Korea's existance."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A country once plauged by fascism is now a mere puppet of its victors. The country once at war is now at peace and is now more prosperous than ever before.

 DDR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Once part of a fascist empire, with a goal on defeating the Red Bear is now the country it never wanted to become. A communist puppet of its eastern victors, forced to defend the idolotry they oppressed."
 KPA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A country once owned by an imperial empire, is now liberated in 1945 by its communist liberators.

 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the United States being a victor of World War 2, it has grew into a prosperous country. American citizens thought the Second World War was the war to end all wars, being able to finally rest. The Soviets claimed much of East Europe, expanding their influences.

 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Blitzkrieg"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last few years the world has seen some new wars break out in Europe and Asia.
