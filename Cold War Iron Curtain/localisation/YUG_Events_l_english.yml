 yug.1.t:0 "The Unification of Trieste"
 yug.1.d:0 "The time has come for the city of Trieste, currently controled by the UNSC, to be brought back to their respective leader. It is panned to split Trieste in Zone A, the main city and Zone B, the countryside outside of Trieste. We would get the countryside and Italy would get the city. Do we allow this split or do we want both parts?"
 yug.1.a:0 "We allow the split."
 yug.1.b:0 "We want both parts!"
 yug.2.t:0 "Threatening from Italy"
 yug.2.d:0 "Italy, siding with the UK and the USA, is threatening us to split the city and not to refuse to it. If we don't back down, we will invade Trieste, but this could lead to war between us and Italy. If we back down, we get our part and everything stays peacefully."
 yug.2.a:0 "We invade! Now!"
 yug.2.b:0 "We stay peacefully."
