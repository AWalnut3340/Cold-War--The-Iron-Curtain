 belgiandecolonization.1.d:0 "The aftermath of World War I brought the Treaty of Versailles to be signed on June 28,1919 by the Central Powers and Entente. The former League of Nations divided up Germany’s colonial empire between the victorious Entente over the next few years. On July 20, 1922 we received the state of Ruanda-Urundi from German East Africa. Ruanda-Urundi was placed on a Class B Mandate to be released once independence was possible. The new United Nations Trust Territory Committee reassigned us the colony in 1946, and a independence referendum as to be supported. A recent referendum was held, and 67% support independence. Ruanda-Urundi is still a strategic region as it supplies into the Congo. Should the mandate on Ruanda-Urundi be dismissed?"
