 vie.2.d:0 "After weeks of talks in the Geneva Conference, the French, State of Vietnam, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have agreed and signed the Geneva Accords. The Geneva Accords state that: 1. A provisional military demarcation line must be made along the 17th Parallel. 2. A 3 mile demilitarized zone on each sides of the border. 3. French Union forces to regroup south of the line and Viet Minh north of the line. 4. Free movement of the population between the zone for 300 days. 5. Neither zone to join any alliances or seek military reinforcements for up to 300 days. 6. An establishment of the International Control Commission to monitor the ceasefire. Both sides have agreed to the terms and it seems like peace will be made in the Indochina region once again."
