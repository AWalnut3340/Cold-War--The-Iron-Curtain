WE ARE LOOKING FOR ACTIVE DEVELOPERS WHO HELP US WITH THE MOD. IF INTERESTED, MESSAGE THE LEADERS ON DISCORD (Link below).

Due to exams, the holidays, etc the next update will be released late January.
There will be several dev diaries by swf and Riprap about new content, so stay tuned!
 

[h1]Cold War: The Iron Curtain[/h1]
This mod adds a [b]Cold War scenario[/b] into Hearts or Iron IV. It starts in 1949, right after the formation of a west-german state, and is planned to end around 1990 or 2000. So, in total, you can play for 41 or 51 years! This of course takes a lot of time and effort to archive, but we are constantly doing our best to bring you the first and most awesome Cold War mod there is on the Steam Workshop!

 [h1]Final Notes[/h1]
- Due to the fact that is mod is a total conversion mod, we highly suggest you not to play with any other mods turned on as they are most likely incompatible. Simple graphics mods like "Colored Buttons" should be fine, but this has to be tested.
- If you encounter startup issues like a black screen or the game not responding: Try to let the game load even though Windows says it's not responing. It should eventually start up (it's because of the game itself, and not mainly our mod)
